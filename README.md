## üåç Overview

This little component is a beginner project from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/ping-single-column-coming-soon-page-5cadd051fec04111f7b848da/hub).

You can see a couple of other little, cutie builds [here](https://github.com/crwainstock/fe-mentor-social-proof) and [here](https://github.com/crwainstock/fe-mentor-product-preview) and [here](https://github.com/crwainstock/fe-mentor-testimonial-grid).

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies & Dependencies

This component was built with HTML, vanilla CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

I also used [PerfectPixel](https://www.welldonecode.com/perfectpixel/) and the [Eye Dropper/Color Picker](https://eyedropper.org/) browser extensions to help with the build.

The social icons are from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/icons).

I deployed the component with Netlify, though, so check that out [here](https://glowing-babka-60bb1c.netlify.app/).
